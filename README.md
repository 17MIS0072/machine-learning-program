# machine-learning-program
machine learning program with k nearest neighbor
This is program executed in jupyter notebook.<br>

**In the first part I performed the following operations:**
- The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is imported from the scikit-learn package.
- Create feature and target variables.
- Split data into training and test data.
- Generate a k-NN model using neighbors value.
- Train or fit the data into the model.
- Predict the future.


**In the second part I checked the accuracy of the model:**

**In the third part I drew a plot to identify the k-value for which we have high accuracy**

so in this way I find the K value.However this is not the process followed by indsutry.Instead they use hyperparameter tuning to choose the value that gives the best performance.
